# Tree Viewer

## Overview

This project provides a customizable tree of your current directory or project. The tool allows you to get a complete structure of your project with options to include hidden directories and exclude specific files or directories.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tree-viewer
```

then run:

```bash
tree-viewer
```

you will see your current directory tree in the console.

### Saving Directory Tree

If you want to save the results of your current directory tree, run:

```bash
tree-viewer --output file_name.txt
```

It will generate the results in the current directory `file_name.txt`.

### Include Hidden Directories

The `tree-viewer` tool now supports including hidden directories in the directory tree structure. Hidden directories are those whose names begin with a dot (`.`, such as `.git` or `.config`). By default, hidden directories are excluded from the tree structure.

To include hidden directories in the tree structure, use the `--hidden` flag:

```bash
tree-viewer --hidden
```

### Exclude Specific Directories and Files

The `tree-viewer` tool also allows you to exclude specific directories or files from the directory tree. This can be useful for omitting directories like `node_modules` or files such as `config.json` that you do not want to appear in the output.

To exclude specific directories or files, use the `--excludes` option followed by the names of the directories or files:

```bash
tree-viewer --excludes .git node_modules config.json
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Installation Path:** Ensure that the Python packages installation path is included in your system's PATH environment variable.
- **Shell Restart:** You might need to restart your shell (like Bash) to recognize changes to the PATH environment variable.
- **Permissions:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute commands from the installed package.
- **Virtual Environment:** If using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated when you attempt to run the command.
